Python-Mindwave
========

This is a library to interface with the Neurosky Mindwave headsets. It can
parse the binary protocol spoken by Neurosky's ThinkGear AM modules. These
modules are used in several headsets and board games, and development kits
are available from Neurosky.

This software is not intended to be used in medical diagnostics or medical
treatment.


Currently this software can only connect to the bluetooth version
(Mindwave Mobile), because I don't possess the other variations.

Edited by Naoto Hieda for Python 3.
Tested with Windows 10 / Python 3.6.0 (Anaconda 4.3.1) / MindWave Mobile Plus.
